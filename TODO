* Make code less ugly
* This API sucks hard, need to make this actually usable
* Don't print headers unless there's data to print afterwards

* Argument parser
	* Add --color argument (default to auto)

* Align column separators of all printed rows?

* Report on changes in:
	* metadata
	* Column types
	* Column orders

* Try to match tables and columns through renames
	* This is hard, we'll need to guess from subdata
