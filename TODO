* Report on changes in:
	* column name
	* column count
	* column order
	* metadata

* Argument parser
	* Specify files on the command-line

* Try harder (or even at all) to partially match rows
	* This could get hairy at times e.g.: we could have 1-col changes potential matches for a single row and have to decide which to match. The best match being that which maximizes the remaining row's partial match col-count. As a first pass, just pick the first one and don't worry about pathological cases
		* Read some more about diff's algorithm and its errors in such cases. Maybe we don't need to get too sophisticated here

* Add LICENSE
